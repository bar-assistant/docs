# AI Integration

Since version v4.7.0 Salt Rim client supports generative AI features.

Enabled features:

- Automatic tag creation for cocktail recipes
- Automatic ingredient details suggestions (description, origin, color...)

More features can be suggested by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/karlomikus/vue-salt-rim/issues).

## Supported providers

To use AI features in Salt Rim, you need to set up an AI provider. Currently the supported providers include:

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) via `ollama` provider settings
    - Keep in mind that you need to [properly configure Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server).
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) via `lmstudio` provider settings

Unsupported providers will fallback to openai compatibile API.

To enable AI integration, you need to setup **salt-rim** environment variables. Here's an example of how to set them up in a default compose file:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
salt-rim:
    environment:
      - AI_PROVIDER="ollama"
      - AI_HOST="http://localhost:11434"
      - AI_MODEL="gemma3"
      - AI_API_KEY="add-if-required"
```

When you're done with the setup, you can visit your Salt Rim instance and check if the AI features are enabled. You can do that on the following pages:

- Cocktail edit/create form page:
    - AI generate button will show up in the tags input field after you fill some basic information about the cocktail.
- Ingredient edit/create form page:
    - AI generate button will show up in the name input field after you fill in the name of the ingredient.
